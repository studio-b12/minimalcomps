### Minimal ActionScript 3.0 UI Components for Flash
http://www.minimalcomps.com

MinimalComps are a set of ActionScript 3.0 User Interface Components for Flash.

They were created with ease of use, small footprint, and performance in mind.
They are ideal for rapid prototyping, experiments and small tools. They are
compatible with Flash on the web, AIR, and the AIR packager for iOS and
Android (though size adjustments would usually have to be made
for mobile platforms).

There is very little styling or skinning possible with MinimalComps. They
were not designed to be highly customizable, visually. And moving forward,
this will probably continue to be very much on the back burner. Decent
styling and skinning is hard. It makes the components more complex, larger
in file size, has performance implications, and introduces many more
avenues for bugs to creep in. Also, no matter how you implement these
things, someone is not going to like the way you did it. MinimalComps
have been amazingly popular despite any real skinning or styling
functionality, and thus weâ€™ll continue with this philosophy of simplicity.
